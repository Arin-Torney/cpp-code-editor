# cpp-code-editor
Hello everyone, this is Arin Torney! I have developed a **code editor for C++**. This code editor is interepreted and yet is only a console app, you will find it truly amazing! It has an effect of _Intellisense_, yet in reality it is nothing more that if-else.
___
As this is a kind of interpreted, you will have to write code a bit differently. One example is this.  
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include 
using namespace std;
using namespace 
#define 

int main() {
cout << "Hello World";
return 0;
}
//exit
```

*P.S. The source code is also given.*
